# BuzzNet: Mosquito Acoustic Classification
Accurate Acoustic Based Deep Learning Model for Mosquitoes Species Classification

**Description:**

Welcome to the BuzzNet: Mosquito Acoustic Classification repository, where we delve into the world of mosquito species classification using cutting-edge acoustic-based deep learning techniques. Our mission is to develop a powerful deep learning model capable of accurately identifying diverse mosquito species based on their unique wingbeat sounds.


**Key Features:**

ü¶ü **High Accuracy:** Our advanced deep learning model is meticulously crafted to achieve remarkable accuracy in classifying a wide range of mosquito species by using raw audio data, aiding in the comprehension and management of disease vectors.

üîä **Acoustic Analysis:** Harnessing the inherent power of mosquito wingbeat sounds, our model detects intricate acoustic patterns, imperceptible to the human ear, that define each species.

üåê **Open Dataset:** As advocates for collaboration and scientific advancement, we utilize a curated dataset of mosquito wingbeat audio recordings from the [HumBugDB: a large-scale acoustic mosquito dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/4904800). We extend our sincere appreciation to the authors for providing this resource.
üß† **Deep Learning Architecture:** Our model leverages a sophisticated neural network architecture tailored for acoustic data analysis, facilitating efficient feature extraction from raw audio data and precise species classification.
üìà **Model Evaluation:** Discover comprehensive evaluation results, meticulously documenting our model's performance across various metrics. This transparency fosters trust and replicability.
