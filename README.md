# BuzzNet: Mosquito Acoustic Classification
Accurate Acoustic Based Deep Learning Model for Mosquitoes Species Classification

**Description:**
Welcome to the MosquitoSonicAI repository, where we delve into the world of mosquito species classification using cutting-edge acoustic-based deep learning techniques. Our mission is to develop a powerful deep learning model capable of accurately identifying diverse mosquito species based on their unique wingbeat sounds.

Key Features:

🦟 High Accuracy: Our advanced deep learning model is meticulously crafted to achieve remarkable accuracy in classifying a wide range of mosquito species, aiding in the comprehension and management of disease vectors.
🔊 Acoustic Analysis: Harnessing the inherent power of mosquito wingbeat sounds, our model detects intricate acoustic patterns, imperceptible to the human ear, that define each species.
🌐 Open Dataset: As advocates for collaboration and scientific advancement, we utilize a curated dataset of mosquito wingbeat audio recordings from the Mosquito Wingbeat Dataset. We extend our sincere appreciation to the authors for providing this resource.
🧠 Deep Learning Architecture: Our model leverages a sophisticated neural network architecture tailored for acoustic data analysis, facilitating efficient feature extraction and precise species differentiation.
📈 Model Evaluation: Discover comprehensive evaluation results, meticulously documenting our model's performance across various metrics. This transparency fosters trust and replicability.
