# BuzzNet: Mosquito Acoustic Classification
A Robust Deep Learning Model for Classification of Mosquitoes Species

**Description:**

Welcome to the BuzzNet: Mosquito Acoustic Classification repository, where we delve into the world of mosquito species classification using cutting-edge acoustic-based deep learning techniques. Our mission is to develop a powerful deep learning model capable of accurately identifying diverse mosquito species based on their unique wingbeat sounds.


**Key Features:**

ü¶ü **High Accuracy:** Our advanced deep learning model is meticulously crafted to achieve remarkable accuracy in classifying a wide range of mosquito species by using raw audio data, aiding in the comprehension and management of disease vectors.

üîä **Acoustic Analysis:** Harnessing the inherent power of mosquito wingbeat sounds, our model detects intricate acoustic patterns, imperceptible to the human ear, that define each species.

üåê **Open Dataset:** As advocates for collaboration and scientific advancement, we utilize a curated dataset of mosquito wingbeat audio recordings from the [HumBugDB: a large-scale acoustic mosquito dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/4904800). We extend our sincere appreciation to the authors for providing this resource.

üß† **Deep Learning Architecture:** Our model leverages a sophisticated neural network architecture tailored for acoustic data analysis, facilitating efficient feature extraction from raw audio data and precise species classification.

üìà **Model Evaluation:** Discover comprehensive evaluation results, meticulously documenting our model's performance across various metrics. This transparency fosters trust and replicability.


**How to Get Started:**

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/Billz22/BuzzNet_Mosquito_Acoustic_Classification.git.
2.  Navigate to the code/ directory and follow the instructions in the README to set up and train the deep learning model.
3.  Gain insights into mosquito species diversity by exploring the curated audio recordings in the data/audio/ directory, graciously provided by the [HumBugDB: a large-scale acoustic mosquito dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/4904800).


**Audio Data Attribution:**

The audio data utilized in this project originates from the [HumBugDB: a large-scale acoustic mosquito dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/4904800), hosted on Zenodo. We express our sincere gratitude to the dataset authors for their contribution. Please be aware that we have not independently created the audio data, but rather leveraged the dataset from the provided source. If you intend to use or reference this dataset, kindly adhere to the terms and conditions set forth by the dataset authors.

For additional information about the dataset's contents, licensing, and usage guidelines, please refer to the original dataset source.


**Data Usage Instructions: Organizing Mosquito Species Data**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
Start by cloning or downloading the repository from GitHub to your local machine.

2.  **Navigate to the Species Directory:**
Inside the repository folder, you'll find separate directories for each mosquito species. These directories are named "an coustani," "an squamosus," "ma africanus," and "ma uniformis."

3.  **Extract Relevant Sets:**
For the mosquito species you're interested in, follow these steps:

    Example: Extracting "an coustani" Data

    Create a new folder with the name "an coustani" in a location of your choice.

    Inside the "an coustani" directory, extract the contents of the zip files named "set-1" and "set-2".

    Now, you have all the audio data for the "an coustani" species in the "an coustani" directory.

4.  **Repeat for Other Species:**
If you need data from other species, repeat the steps above for the relevant species directories and corresponding sets.

5.  **Using the Extracted Data:**
Once you've organized the data according to the species, you can use the audio files for analysis or any other tasks.
